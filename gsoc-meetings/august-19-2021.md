See notebooks [here](https://github.com/larryshamalama/pymc3-playground/blob/master/notebooks/step-by-step/test-multiple-dp-samples.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/larryshamalama/pymc3-playground/blob/master/notebooks/step-by-step/test-two-level-sampling.ipynb)

#### What I worked on

- First, getting the exercise mentioned last week done right
- Retrieving data-generating parameters with using two-level sampling

#### Specific question

- Using `rng.multinomial` still has some atoms that are unobserved. Because Beta r.v.'s cannot be observed to be 0 or 1, I temporarily discard samples with unobserved atoms. This leads to right results. Is this okay?
- Should we start thinking about API design?
    - Should `DirichletProcess` be its own class (akin to GPs) or inherit from `RandomVariable`?
    - Ultimately, my understanding is that we want to be able to something like:

```{python}
with pm.Model() as model:
    G0 = pm.Normal("G0", mu=0., sigma=3.)
    dp = pm.DirichletProcess("dp", concentration=5., base_dist=G0, observed=y)
```

- Post-GSoC: will we be able to continue to meet? Are there funds (for students and mentors) to continue working on this?
- Minor: `pm.sample_prior_predictive()` does not seem to work with Aesara 2.1.3

#### Administrative

 - [Work Submission Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/work-product) and last evaluation

#### Personal level

- How to stay more involved?
