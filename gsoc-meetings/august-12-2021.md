#### What I worked on

- (Taken from July 29) Retrieving concentration parameter from weights (notebook [here](https://github.com/larryshamalama/pymc3-playground/blob/master/notebooks/progress/dp-recover-basic-parameters.ipyn
b))
        - I suspect that my simulations don't work well with small M values due to precision error. It might not be the case. [Here](https://github.com/larryshamalama/pymc3-playgrou
nd/blob/master/notebooks/shortcomings/replicate-precision-error.ipynb)
- Posterior DP in numpy (see [notebook](https://github.com/larryshamalama/pymc3-playground/blob/master/notebooks/progress/dp-posterior-numpy.ipynb))
- Integrating atoms with weights for DP prior
