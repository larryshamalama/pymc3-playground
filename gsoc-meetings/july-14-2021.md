#### What I worked on

- Type checking in `DirichletProcess`
- Creating `DirichletProcessMixture` to replicate analyses [here](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/dp_mix.html) and [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section5_2-Dirichlet-Processes.ipynb).
- Testing `pm.Potential`
	- Getting some bad initial energy errors despite initially successful runs

#### Specific Questions

- Question from last meeting: what do we want to come out from the other end? Perhaps we can draw some inspiration from the [`dirichletprocess`](https://github.com/dm13450/dirichletprocess) R package.
	- Atoms for basic `DirichletProcess` and mixture component chains for `DirichletProcessMixture`?
	- Discuss overall design of classes and methods to include
- Austin mentioned that we can build tests to retrieve the concentation parameter from weights
- What do we want the base distribution `DirichletProcess` to do?
- `pm.Potential` in v4: how to make it work?
	- My understanding is that this is necessary to have a likelihood in the model (`pm.DensityDist` and `pm.Mixture` need to be refactored in v4).

### Broad Questions

- Advice on creating tests
