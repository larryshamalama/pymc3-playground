Link to WIP DP [PR](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/4809) for convenience.

#### What I worked on

- Type checking in `DirichletProcess`
- Creating `DirichletProcessMixture` to replicate analyses [here](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/dp_mix.html) and [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section5_2-Dirichlet-Processes.ipynb).
- Testing `pm.Potential`
	- Getting some bad initial energy errors despite initially successful runs
	- When no bad initial energy (?), plots seem slightly off (see [notebook](https://github.com/larryshamalama/pymc3-playground/blob/master/notebooks/test-potential.ipynb)).

#### Specific Questions

- Question from last meeting: what do we want to come out from the other end? Perhaps we can draw some inspiration from the [`dirichletprocess`](https://github.com/dm13450/dirichletprocess) R package.
	- Atoms for basic `DirichletProcess` and mixture component chains for `DirichletProcessMixture`?
	- Discuss overall design of classes and methods to include
	- What do we want the base distribution `DirichletProcess` to do?
	- Basic Dirichlet Process has dirac functions. How to write a likelihood so we can use `obs=...`?
- Austin mentioned that we can build tests to retrieve the concentation parameter from weights
- Would `DirichletProcessMixture` integrate better with PyMC3 sampling than `DirichletProcess`?

### Broad Questions

- Advice on creating tests

### Administrative

- Theory exams on August 3rd and 5th
- Evaluations due tomorrow
