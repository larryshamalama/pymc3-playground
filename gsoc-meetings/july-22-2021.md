#### What I worked on

- [This](https://github.com/larryshamalama/pymc3-playground/blob/master/notebooks/progress/dp-using-likelihood.ipynb) notebook where I implement a dirichlet process with a N(0, 1) base measure
    - Error `ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (38,) (38,) (19,)`: posterior sampling not working

#### Specific Questions

- Discrete index parameters in [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/AustinRochford/591b16363e7fa1ebd55ce3f2fbaeb6a4) notebook for DP Mixtures or any DP?

#### Administrative

- Looking into the future: I'd love to present this project given that I make good progress. Should I look into PyData?
